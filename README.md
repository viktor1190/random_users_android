# This is an Android project based in the Architecture Blueprints - AAC + Dagger2 + Dagger-Android

### Summary
This sample is written in Kotlin and based on the
[master](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/master) branch which uses
the following Architecture Components:
 - ViewModel
 - LiveData
 - Data Binding
 - Navigation
 - Room

It uses [Dagger 2](https://dagger.dev) and
[Dagger-Android](https://dagger.dev/android.html) for dependency injection. The Dagger setup is
deliberately simple and unopinionated.
