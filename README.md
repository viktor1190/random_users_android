# Random users + Infinite scroll from API - Android Use Case

![Demo](demo.gif)

### This is an Android project based in the Architecture Blueprints + Dagger2 + Dagger-Android
### Summary
This interview demo app was created in Kotlin and based in one of the templates of the Google Sample repostory at:
[master](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/master) which uses
the following Architecture Components:
 - ViewModel
 - LiveData
 - Data Binding
 - Navigation
 - Room
 - Paging Jetpack
 - Coroutines for async operations

It uses [Dagger 2](https://dagger.dev) and
[Dagger-Android](https://dagger.dev/android.html) for dependency injection. The Dagger setup is
deliberately simple and unopinionated.
